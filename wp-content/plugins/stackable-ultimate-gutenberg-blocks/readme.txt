== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

You’ll need the **Gutenberg plugin** for this to work. Once you’ve downloaded both Gutenberg and your copy of Stackable, install both on your WordPress website, activate them, and you’re good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is Gutenberg and why do I need it for Stackable to work?**

Gutenberg is a beta project by Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress. It’s a visual builder prototype of the new WordPress editor that’s coming out with WordPress 5.0 sometime this year.

Since it’s yet to be fully integrated with WordPress, Gutenberg comes as a separate plugin for developers and beta testers. Stackable is an add-on for the current Gutenberg plugin, so you’ll need both of them installed for you to use Stackable.

**Why would I need an add-on for Gutenberg?**

Currently, Gutenberg has some of the most basic features needed to create a website. However, we wanted to extend its current functionality by developing more options for designing and creating your Gutenberg-built website. Along with the additional blocks, Stackable also lets you change colors, edit text and shape sizes, and tweak your blocks styles.

**Can I use this add-on for other page builders I’m using?**

Nope. Stackable only works with Gutenberg.
